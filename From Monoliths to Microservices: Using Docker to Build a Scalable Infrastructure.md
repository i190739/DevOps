## From Monoliths to Microservices: Using Docker to Build a Scalable Infrastructure:
The blog "From Monoliths to Microservices: Using Docker to Build a Scalable Infrastructure" explains the benefits of using a microservices architecture for building scalable and flexible applications. It then discusses how Docker can be used to build and manage the infrastructure for microservices. The article outlines three main steps to follow: defining the microservices, building the Docker images for each service, and orchestrating the services using Docker Compose or Kubernetes. By following these steps, developers can create a modular and agile infrastructure that can easily adapt to changes and handle large-scale traffic.
